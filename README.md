### Project Description

We designed an application so users can build a ready-to-publish business website by grabbing ther information from Yelp. 
We offer three different templates for the user to choose, and if the business is listed i Yelp, by selecting their business the website is automatically generated. 
On the other hand, if the business is not published in Yelp, the user can fill out a form.


### Key Elements and Features

- Ready to go website templates for the user to choose
- Yelp API call by clicking just one button, storing all business information in a database.
- Optional form fill.
- Once website is ready, user can choose to save the code for later use or save it as a PDF file.
